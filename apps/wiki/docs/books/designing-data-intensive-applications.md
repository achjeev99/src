# Designing Data-Intensive Applications

by Martin Kleppmann

## Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

- Many applications are data-intensive and not compute intensive.

### Thinking About Data Systems

- This book focuses on three main concerns: reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

### Reliability

- Reliability means the system continues to work correctly, even when things go wrong.

#### Hardware Faults

- TODO

#### Software Errors

- TODO

#### Human Errors

- TODO

### Scalability

- Scalability is the term we use to describe a system's ability to cope with increased load.

#### Describing Load

- TODO

#### Describing Performance

- Look at what happens when load increases.
  - When you increase a load parameter and keep system resources fixed, how is the performance of your system affected?
  - When you increase a load parameter, how much do you need to increase the resources if you want to keep performance unchanged?
- Response time what the client sees.
- Latency.
- Tail latencies are important because they directly affect users' experience of the service.
- Even if you call multiple backend services in parallel, the end-user request must wait for the slowest of the parallel calls to complete.
- The right way of aggregating response time data is to add the histograms.

#### Approaches for Coping with Load

- Vertical scaling is moving to a more powerful machine. Horizontal scaling distributes the load across multiple smaller machines.
- In an early-stage startup it's more important to be able to iterate quickly on product features than to scale beyond some hypothetical future load.

### Maintainability

- The majority of the cost of software is not in its initial development, but its ongoing maintenance.
- Three important design principles for maintainability are:
  - Operability: Make it easy for the operations teams to keep the system running smoothly.
  - Simplicity: Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system by removing complexity.
  - Evolvability (or extensibility): Make it easy for engineers to adapt the system to unanticipated use cases as requirements change.

#### Operability: Making Life Easy for Operations

- TODO

#### Simplicity: Managing Complexity

- Making a system simpler does not necessarily mean reducing its functionality; it can also mean removing *accidental complexity*.
- Accidental complexity is complexity that is not inherent in the problem that the software solves, but arises only from the implementation.
- Good abstractions are one of the best tools for removing accidental complexity by hiding implementation details, but finding good abstractions is very hard.

#### Evolvability: Making Change Easy

- Simple and easy-to-understand systems are usually easier to modify than complex ones.

### Summary

* Functional requirements are what an application should do.
* Nonfunctional requirements are general properties like security, reliability, compliance, scalability, compatibility, and maintainability.

## Chapter 2: Data Models and Query Languages

- Data models are the most important part of developing software, because they affect not only how the software is written, but how we think about the problem that we're solving.
- TODO

### Relational Model Versus Document Model

#### The Birth of NoSQL

- TODO

#### The Object-Relational Mismatch

- Impedance mismatch is the disconnect between objects in the application code and the database model of tables, rows, and columns.
- A JSON representation of a document-oriented database has better locality than an equivalent multi-table schema.

#### Many-to-One and Many-to-Many Relationships

## Chapter 3: Storage and Retrieval

- There is a big difference between storage engines optimized for transactional workloads and those optimized for analytics.

### Data Structures That Power Your Database

- *Log* is defined as an append-only sequence of records. It doesn't have to be human-readable, and instead might be binary.
- Well-chosen indexes speed up read queries, but every index slows down writes, because the index also needs to be updated every time data is written.

#### Hash Indexes

- TODO

#### SSTables and LSM-Trees

- TODO

##### Constructing and maintaining SSTables

- TODO

##### Making an LSM-tree out of SSTables

* Storage engines based on the principle of merging and compacting sorted files are called LSM (Log-Structured Merge) storage engines.

##### Performance optimizations

- TODO

#### B-Trees

- B-trees remain the standard index implementation in almost all relational databases, and many non-relational databases use them too.
- B-trees break down the database into fixed-size *blocks* or *pages* (usually 4KB) and read or write one page at a time. This maps closely to the underlying disk hardware.
- TODO

##### Making B-trees reliable

- TODO

##### B-tree optimizations

- TODO

#### Comparing B-Trees and LSM-Trees

- LSM-trees are typically faster for writes, whereas B-trees are thought to be faster for reads.

##### Advantages of LSM-trees

- TODO

##### Downsides of LSM-trees

- TODO

#### Other Indexing Structures

##### Storing values within the index

- TODO

##### Multi-column indexes

- TODO

##### Full-text search and fuzzy indexes

* In Lucene, the in-memory index is a finite state automaton over the characters in the keys, similar to a trie.
* This automaton can be transformed into a *Levenshtein automaton*, which supports efficient search for words within a given edit distance.

##### Keeping everything in memory

* In-memory databases are faster because they avoid the overheads of encoding in-memory data structures in a form that can be written to disk.
* In-memory databases are not faster because they don't need to read from disk â€“ the operating system caches recently used disk blocks in memory anyway.

#### Stars and Snowflakes: Schemas for Analytics

### Column-Oriented Storage

- Although fact tables are often over 100 columns wide, a typical data warehouse query only accesses 4 or 5 of them at one time.
- *Column-oriented storage* stores all the values from each column together, instead of all the values from each row together.
- The column-oriented storage layout relies on each column file containing the rows in the same order.

## Chapter 5: Replication

- Reasons to replicate data include reducing access latency by moving data geographically close to users, increasing availability, and increasing read throughput.
- All the difficulty in replication lies in handling *changes* to replicated data.

### Leaders and Followers

- *Leader-based replication*, or *active/passive replication*, is the most common solution to ensuring that data is persisted to all replicas.
- Whenever the leader writes new data to its local storage, it also sends the data change to each of its followers via a *replication log* or *change stream*.

#### Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Replication

- TODO

#### Setting Up New Followers

- TODO

#### Handling Node Outages

##### Follower failure: Catch-up recovery

- The follower can connect to the leader and, via the replication log, consume all data changes that occurred while the follower was disconnected.

##### Leader failure: Failover

- A *failover* requires promoting one follower as the new leader, reconfiguring clients to send data to the new leader, and reconfiguring other followers to consume data changes from the new leader.
- TODO

#### Implementation of Replication Logs

##### Statement-based replication

- Replicating every write request (statement) from a leader to its followers has many edge cases (e.g. non-determinism from `NOW()` or `RAND()`) and is not preferred.

##### Write-ahead log (WAL) shipping

- The WAL details which bytes were changed in which blocks. It's thus a poor choice for a replication log, e.g. you cannot run different versions of the database on leaders and followers.

##### Logical (row-based) log replication

- A logical log is a sequence of records describing writes to database tables with row granularity. This is the approach MySQL's binlog uses.
- Logical logs are decoupled from storage engine internals and therefore backward compatible, and are also easier for external applications to parse.

##### Custom conflict resolution logic

* *Conflict-free replicated data types* (CDRTs) are data structures (e.g. sets, maps, ordered lists, etc) that automatically resolve conflicts in sensible ways.
* *Mergeable persistent data structures* track history explicitly and use a three-way merge function (similar to Git).
* *Operational transformations* are for concurrent editing of an ordered list of items, and are used by Etherpad and Google Docs.
