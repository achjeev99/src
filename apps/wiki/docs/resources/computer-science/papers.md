# Papers

Good papers in Computer Science (CS).

I follow _[The Morning Paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/)_. It's a random walk through Computer Science research, by Adrian Colyer. I love reading Adrian's short summary of an important, influential, topical or otherwise interesting paper in the field of Computer Science. The series of "a paper each week" is very good. I miss his summary already.

I also subscribe (RSS and email) to Simon Frey's _[Weekly CS Paper](https://simon-frey.com/weeklycspaper/)_ to get a CS paper every weekend into my inbox.
