# Computer Science

## What is Computer Science

Computer Science (abbreviated as CS) is the study of computation, automation,
and information. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as
[algorithms](algorithms), [theory of computation](other-topics),
[information theory](other-topics), and automation) to practical disciplines
(including the design and implementation of [[hardware]] and [[software]]).
Computer science is generally considered an area of academic research and
distinct from [[computer programming]].[^1]

## Get Started

I loved reading [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) and [CS:APP](http://csappbook.blogspot.com/) book. It explains computing very well from ground up. What else? [What CS books should I read?](books)

Here's my **personal** selections:

If you're self-studying, check out: _[Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)_ by Bradfield School of CS.

The CS field is never short of good open [university classes and courses](education). There are many CS curriculum, both informal (opinionated) and formal. One of them is _[Path to a free self-taught education in Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)_ by OSSU (Open Source Society University). Formal or not, everyone has a different path to their CS education. More education stuffs [here](education).

Beyond that, continue [reading papers](papers) (or paper summaries) and implement CS ideas. Here's a few good starting points:
- Get "a paper each week" from _[The Morning Paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/)_ by Adrian Colyer.
- [BaseCS](https://medium.com/basecs) - Exploring the basics of computer science, every Monday, for a year.

[Articles](articles-notes) are also good source for CS readings.

Many students and learners have [written notes](articles-notes#notes) about things they learned.

What about videos? I got you [covered](videos).

If you are into specific CS topics such as programming language theory or Turing, check [other topics](other-topics). [Data structures](data-structures) and [algorithms](algorithms) is a larger topic separated from this.

Lastly, keep learning by staying connected to the world-wide [CS communities](social-media).
