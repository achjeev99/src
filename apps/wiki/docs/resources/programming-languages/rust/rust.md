# [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)

I learn Rust by reading [The Rust Programming Language](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) (aka. TRPL) book.

This is my ~~mind map and~~ collection of resources for learning Rust in early 2019.

I didn't touch Rust up until Nov 2019. I've written a [short note](learn-rust-again) about things I read and learned while restarting my Rust learning journey.

## Notes

My notes while working through TRPL.

**Programming paradigm:** functional, imperative, structured, generic, concurrent

**Rust focus:** type and memory safety, precision, concurrency, performance, reliability

Rust enforces memory safety. Compile time memory safety guarantees protects us from:

- Uninitialized variables
- Use-after-free (UAV)
- Double-frees
- Exception due to NULL pointers (Rust does not have NULL)
- Impossible to forget to lock the mutex
- Data races between threads
- _Mostly_ no memory leaks
- Iterator invalidation

In the safe subset of Rust, there's no undefined behavior at runtime:

- Integer overflow is defined
- Array access is bounds checked

Rust is modern â€” built with the experience learned in the past 40 years of programming languages.

Modern language features:
- Generics
- Enums and pattern matching
- No overhead FFI

Modern tooling:
- Great compiler errors
- Built-in dependency manager
- Built-in support for testing

The course covers the full spectrum of Rust, from basic syntax to advanced topics like generics and error handling. It also includes Android-specific content on the last day.

### Videos

Rust stream on YouTube and/or Twitch:

- [Jon Gjengset's stream on Rust](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_iD0xppBwwsrM9DegC5cQQ) - I first discovered Jon's stream while looking at [Noria](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria) data-flow for high-performance web apps. Jon's stream covers mostly advanced concepts in Rust but not until recently (2020) where he started to covers more "advanced beginners" stuffs.
- [Ryan Levick's "advanced beginners" stream on Rust](https://youtu.be/2mwwYbBRJSo) who are familiar with the concepts of ownership, closures and threads but don't yet have a firm grip on them.
- [Visualizing memory layout of Rust's data types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDoqT-a6UFg)
- [Intorust screencasts](http://intorust.com/) by Niko Matsakis.

## Books

- [Rust for Rustaceans](https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/nq3pxh/new_rust_book_rust_for_rustaceans_by_jon_gjengset/) by Jon Gjengset - a book that covers the next steps of Rust after TRPL/"the book". The book is written for people who are already familiar with Rust. The idea is that you read The Rust Programming Language (TRPL) first, play around with Rust for a bit on your own, maybe start using it "for real", and then pick this up to hone your skills. It is fairly fast paced, but is still has a good amount of low level details. (TLDR; if you're comfortable in Rust, this book is the next step up for intermediate developers.)
- [Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action) by Tim McNamara - Systems programming concepts and techniques.
  - [Book launch announcement](https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/bthr5n/rust_in_action_by_ts_mcnamara_published_by/)
- [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/) by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, Leonora F. S. Tindall - This revised, second edition covers the Rust 2021 Edition. It expands on many concepts in TRPL book. I like that it explains the **memory layout of common Rust data structures**.
- [The Rustonomicon book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/meet-safe-and-unsafe.html) - Meet Safe and Unsafe.
- [Summary of the Rust book](https://github.com/psibi/rust-book-summary)
- [Zero To Production In Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/) - The ideal starting point for your journey as a Rust backend developer. You will learn by doing: you will build a fully functional email newsletter API, starting from scratch.
- [Awesome Rust Books](https://github.com/sger/RustBooks) - List of Rust books grouped by level.

## Presentations and talks

- [Rust: A Language for the Next Forty Years](https://is.gd/rust40) by Carol Nichols - A talk about Rust's safety and stability. And a little bit about railroads.
- [Learning systems programming with Rust](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/09/11/rustconf-keynote/) - Closing keynote at the first RustConf 2016 by Julia Evans.

## Cheat sheets

- https://cheats.rs/
- [Rust container cheat sheet (Google Docs)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q-c7UAyrUlM-eZyTo1pd8SZ0qwA_wYxmPZVOQkoDmH4/edit?usp=sharing) - Explaining Rust in terms of actual in-memory representations by [Raph Levien](https://raphlinus.github.io/). Raph think this will be helpful because, most often, these basic Rust types (Vec, Box, Arc) are presented in terms of their abstraction, and the in-memory representation is considered an advanced detail, more a topic for the nomicon. I like it because it clarify things visually.
- [Another container cheat sheet](https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/idwlqu/rust_memory_container_cheatsheet_publish_on_github/) [[Source](https://github.com/usagi/rust-memory-container-cs)]
- [See all implementations for Rust and Go side-by-side](https://programming-idioms.org/cheatsheet/Go/Rust)
- https://github.com/donbright/rust-lang-cheat-sheet - This cheat sheet is in a reasonably useful state for basic things.
