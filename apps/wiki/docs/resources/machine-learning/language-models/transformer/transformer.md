    <details>
      <summary>A clever dual masking-and-caching algorithm.</summary>

      - This is NOT "just throwing more compute" at the problem.
      - The authors have devised a clever dual-masking-plus-caching mechanism to induce an attention-based model to learn to predict tokens from all possible permutations of the factorization order of all other tokens in the same input sequence.
      - In expectation, the model learns to gather information from all positions on both sides of each token in order to predict the token.
      - For example, if the input sequence has four tokens, ["The", "cat", "is", "furry"], in one training step the model will try to predict "is" after seeing "The", then "cat", then "furry".
      - In another training step, the model might see "furry" first, then "The", then "cat".
      - Note that the original sequence order is always retained, e.g., the model always knows that "furry" is the fourth token.
      - The masking-and-caching algorithm that accomplishes this does not seem trivial to me.
      - The improvements to SOTA performance in a range of tasks are significant -- see tables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in the paper.

TLDR: introduces a new 70B LM called "Chinchilla" that outperforms much bigger LMs (GPT-3, Gopher). DeepMind has found the secret to cheaply scale large language models — to be compute-optimal, model size and training data must be scaled equally. It shows that most LLMs are severely starved of data and under-trained. Given the [new scaling law](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/6Fpvch8RR29qLEWNH/chinchilla-s-wild-implications), even if you pump a quadrillion parameters into a model (GPT-4 urban myth), the gains will not compensate for 4x more training tokens.
20. [Improving language models by retrieving from trillions of tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04426) by Borgeaud et al. at DeepMind - The group explore an alternate path for efficient training with Internet-scale retrieval. The method is known as RETRO, for "Retrieval Enhanced TRansfOrmers". With RETRO **the model is not limited to the data seen during training – it has access to the entire training dataset through the retrieval mechanism. This results in significant performance gains compared to a standard Transformer with the same number of parameters**. RETRO obtains comparable performance to GPT-3 on the Pile dataset, despite using 25 times fewer parameters. They show that language modeling improves continuously as they increase the size of the retrieval database. [[blog post](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/improving-language-models-by-retrieving-from-trillions-of-tokens)]

Flan-PaLM 540B achieves SoTA performance on several benchmarks. They also publicly release [Flan-T5 checkpoints](https://github.com/google-research/t5x/blob/main/docs/models.md#flan-t5-checkpoints), which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B.

23. [Nonparametric Masked (NPM) Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01349) by Meta AI et al. [[code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/NPM)] - Nonparametric models with **500x fewer parameters outperform GPT-3 on zero-shot tasks.**
    > It, crucially, does not have a softmax over a fixed output vocabulary, but instead has a fully nonparametric distribution over phrases. This is in contrast to a recent (2022) body of work that incorporates nonparametric components in a parametric model.
    >
    > Results show that NPM is significantly more parameter-efficient, outperforming up to 500x larger parametric models and up to 37x larger retrieve-and-generate models.

#### ChatGPT

[What is ChatGPT?](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)

**TL;DR:** ChatGPT is a conversational web interface, backed by OpenAI's newest language model fine-tuned from a model in the [GPT-3.5 series](https://beta.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers) (which finished training in early 2022), optimized for dialogue. It is trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF); human AI trainers provide supervised fine-tuning by playing both sides of the conversation.

It's evidently better than GPT-3 at following user instructions and context. [People have noticed](https://archive.ph/m6AOQ) ChatGPT's output quality seems to represent a notable improvement over previous GPT-3 models.

For more, please take a look at [ChatGPT Universe](https://github.com/cedrickchee/chatgpt-universe). This is my fleeting notes on everything I understand about ChatGPT and stores a collection of interesting things about ChatGPT.

15. [OPT-IML (OPT + Instruction Meta-Learning) (paper)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/main/projects/OPT-IML/optimal_paper_v1.pdf) by Meta AI - OPT-IML is a set of instruction-tuned versions of OPT, on a collection of ~2000 NLP tasks — for research use cases. It boosts the performance of the original OPT-175B model using instruction tuning to improve zero-shot and few-shot generalization abilities — allowing it to adapt for more diverse language applications (i.e., answering Q’s, summarizing text). This improves the model's ability to better process natural instruction style prompts. Ultimately, humans should be able to "talk" to models as naturally and fluidly as possible.

## Transfer Learning in NLP

<details>

<summary>NLP finally had a way to do transfer learning probably as well as Computer Vision could.</summary>
As Jay Alammar put it:

> The year 2018 has been an inflection point for machine learning models handling text (or more accurately, Natural Language Processing or NLP for short). Our conceptual understanding of how best to represent words and sentences in a way that best captures underlying meanings and relationships is rapidly evolving. Moreover, the NLP community has been putting forward incredibly powerful components that you can freely download and use in your own models and pipelines (It's been referred to as [NLP's ImageNet moment](http://ruder.io/nlp-imagenet/), referencing how years ago similar developments accelerated the development of machine learning in Computer Vision tasks).
>
> One of the latest milestones in this development is the [release](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) of [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert), an event [described](https://twitter.com/lmthang/status/1050543868041555969) as marking the beginning of a new era in NLP. BERT is a model that broke several records for how well models can handle language-based tasks. Soon after the release of the paper describing the model, the team also open-sourced the code of the model, and made available for download versions of the model that were already pre-trained on massive datasets. This is a momentous development since it enables anyone building a machine learning model involving language processing to use this powerhouse as a readily-available component – saving the time, energy, knowledge, and resources that would have gone to training a language-processing model from scratch.
>
> BERT builds on top of a number of clever ideas that have been bubbling up in the NLP community recently – including but not limited to [Semi-supervised Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01432) (by [Andrew Dai](https://twitter.com/iamandrewdai) and [Quoc Le](https://twitter.com/quocleix)), [ELMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365) (by Matthew Peters and researchers from [AI2](https://allenai.org/) and [UW CSE](https://www.engr.washington.edu/about/bldgs/cse)), [ULMFiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) (by [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) founder [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) and [Sebastian Ruder](https://twitter.com/seb_ruder)), the [OpenAI transformer](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf) (by OpenAI researchers [Radford](https://twitter.com/alecrad), [Narasimhan](https://twitter.com/karthik_r_n), [Salimans](https://twitter.com/timsalimans), and [Sutskever](https://twitter.com/ilyasut)), and the Transformer ([Vaswani et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).
>
> **ULMFiT: Nailing down Transfer Learning in NLP**
>
> [ULMFiT introduced methods to effectively utilize a lot of what the model learns during pre-training](http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html) – more than just embeddings, and more than contextualized embeddings. ULMFiT introduced a language model and a process to effectively fine-tune that language model for various tasks.
