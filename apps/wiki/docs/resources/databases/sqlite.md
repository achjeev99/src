# [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org)

## Getting Started

- [SQLite In 5 Minutes Or Less](https://www.sqlite.org/quickstart.html) - A very quick introduction to programming with SQLite.

## Documentations

Important links to official documentations:

- [Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) - Transaction control using a write-ahead log offers more concurrency and is often faster than the default rollback transactions. This document explains how to use WAL mode for improved performance.
- [Command-Line Shell (sqlite3.exe)](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html) - Notes on using the "sqlite3.exe" command-line interface that can be used to create, modify, and query arbitrary SQLite database files.
- [Overview Of The Optimizer](https://www.sqlite.org/optoverview.html) - A quick overview of the various query optimizations that are attempted by the SQLite code generator.
- [Quirks, Caveats, and Gotchas In SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html)

- [35% Faster Than The Filesystem](https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html) - This article points out that reading blobs out of an SQLite database is often faster than reading the same blobs from individual files in the filesystem.

- [SQLite Renaissance](https://matt-rickard.com/sqlite-renaissance) - Address the question: "What's the reason SQLite has been a trending topic for data/backend use cases recently (2022)? It's been around for 20+ years. I'm just curious if something about our world fundamentally changed.". TL;DR:
  > 1. embeddable at the edge (WASM, etc.)
  >
  > 2. easy connection pooling for serverless (flatfile)
  >
  > 3. embeddable at the runtime (browser, -as-a-library, etc.)
  >
  > 4. NFS getting faster, so easy and cheap alternative for blogs, etc.

- [HC-tree](https://sqlite.org/hctree/doc/hctree/doc/hctree/index.html) - A project attempting to develop a new database backend that improves upon regular SQLite: high-concurrency, support for replication, and beyond 16TiB database size limit.

## Research

### Papers

- [SQLite: Past, Present, and Future](https://vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/15/paper/SQLite%3A%20Past%2C%20Present%2C%20and%20Future) by University of Wisconsin-Madison and SQLite developers, 2022, VLDB - The paper compares SQLite and DuckDB, and describes some optimization work to make SQLite perform better for analytical queries.
