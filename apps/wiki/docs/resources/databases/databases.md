# Databases

Broadly, a database is a large, integrated collection of data stored and accessed electronically.

A database management system (DBMS) is a software system designed to store, manage, and facilitate access to databases.

Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few understand how database systems actually work.

I use:
- [PostgreSQL](postgresql.md)
- [SQlite](https://www.sqlite.org)
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)
- [ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse)
- [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb)
- [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb)
- [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com/)
