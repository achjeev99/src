  The 3rd edition of course.fast.ai - coming in 2019. This 7-week course is designed for anyone with at least a year of coding experience, and some memory of high-school math. The course is taught in Python, using the fastai library and PyTorch. You will start with step one—learning how to get a GPU server online suitable for deep learning—and go all the way through to creating state of the art, highly practical, models for computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.
